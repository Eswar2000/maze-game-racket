Problem Definition
The maze game is a game of guiding the protagonist from the source to the destination crossing series of obstacles like walls and bombs. The obstacles are defined as follows:
•	Walls – obstructs movement of the protagonist in that direction
•	Bombs – secret mines that kills the protagonist
The protagonist can move in the four directions: up, down, left, and right. The aim of the player is to guide our protagonist across several of the obstacles to reach the destination. It can be noted that there may be several paths that can reach to the destination. As the protagonist reaches the destination successfully, the player is provided with the score (number of steps to reach the destination).
This game is a graphical representation of classical maze games that employs several SICP concepts at various levels to accomplish certain behaviors.
The following characters are graphically represented in the maze to the left:
(a)     Protagonist – Yellow Pacman
(b)     Brown Cells – Walls
(c)     Blue Cells – Paths
(d)     Red Cell – Destination

It should be noted that bombs are invisible to the players and hence players must be careful while moving across the maze.
